# Dailyprogress
App to automate tracking my daily progress. 


Previously I had been writing simple updates to a text file and pushing that to github. I think building an app to automate this and
provide a nice presentation along with stats would be a good project to undertake. 

It should be very easy to checkin. 

Basic skeletal functionality would be doing clock in/out and saving what i did to the db, displaying results from db. 

Clock in
What I worked on
Clock out. 

Modify time as needed. 

Tags sorted by time spent/week/month 
Stats - minutes per day/week/month. Most active time, simple trends. 

Tech stack - 
Looking at using clementine.js as a starting point. Might try ejs for templating engine.
